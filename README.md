## 🎯 Problem Statement

Crop diseases cause an estimated **$220 billion** in agricultural losses annually worldwide. Smallholder farmers — who produce 70% of the world's food — often lack access to expert agronomists for timely disease diagnosis.

This application provides an instant, AI-powered diagnostic tool that any farmer can use by simply uploading a photo of a diseased leaf.

---

## ✅ What It Does

Upload a leaf image and the app returns:

- **Disease identification** — which disease is affecting the crop
- **Confidence score** — how certain the model is
- **Severity assessment** — Early / Moderate / Advanced stage
- **Treatment recommendations** — specific, actionable steps
- **Prevention advice** — how to avoid recurrence
- **Top 3 predictions** — alternative possibilities with confidence scores

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

**Why EfficientNetB0?**
EfficientNetB0 provides an excellent accuracy-to-size ratio. It achieves higher accuracy than VGG16 and ResNet50 at a fraction of the model size — critical for deployment on resource-constrained servers.

**Why two-phase training?**
Phase 1 trains only the classification head while the pre-trained ImageNet features remain intact. This prevents catastrophic forgetting. Phase 2 fine-tunes the top layers with a very low learning rate to adapt high-level features to plant disease patterns without destroying lower-level feature extraction.

**Why 14 classes instead of 38?**
The 14 selected classes cover the most agriculturally significant diseases in India — Tomato, Corn, Apple, Potato and Grape. A focused model on fewer high-impact classes outperforms a diluted model across all 38 classes in real-world deployment.

**The preprocessing challenge:**
During development, EfficientNetB0 in Keras 3 / TensorFlow 2.19 required raw 0-255 pixel values rather than normalized 0-1 values. Passing normalized inputs caused the model to output random 7% accuracy across all classes regardless of training. Identifying and fixing this preprocessing mismatch through systematic diagnostic testing was a critical engineering challenge in this project.

## 📈 Dataset

- **Source:** [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) by Samir Bhattarai
- **Total images used:** ~26,000 (14 selected classes)
- **Training images:** ~21,000
- **Validation images:** 6,667
- **Image size:** 224×224 pixels
- **Augmentation:** Rotation, shift, shear, zoom, horizontal flip, brightness adjustment

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Currently supports 5 crops and 14 disease classes — does not cover all crop types
- Severity assessment uses visual heuristics — not a trained severity model
- Performance may vary on low-quality or blurry images
- Not a replacement for professional agronomist advice for severe cases

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Expand to all 38 disease classes
- Train a dedicated CNN severity grading model using annotated severity datasets
- Add multi-language support for regional Indian languages
- Build a mobile app for offline use in areas with poor connectivity
- Integrate with government agricultural advisory APIs
